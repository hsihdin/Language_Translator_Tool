## Language Translation Tool
This is a simple language translation tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to translate text from one language to another. It provides a user-friendly interface for translating text, allowing users to input the text, source language, and target language.

Getting Started
To use this tool, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-translation-tool.git
Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:


```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Set up your OpenAI API key:

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, sign up at OpenAI to obtain one.
Add your API key to an environment variable named SECRET_TOKEN.
Run the application:


```python app.py```
Access the translation tool by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:7860.

Usage
Enter the text you want to translate into the "Input Text" textbox.
Specify the source language (e.g., English) and target language (e.g., Hindi) in the respective textboxes.
Click the "Translate" button to see the translated text.
Example
Here's an example of how the translation tool works:

```Input Text: "Hello, how are you?"
Source Language: "English"
Target Language: "Spanish"```

```Translated Text: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"```

Notes
This tool utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 engine (text-davinci-003) for translation.
The max_tokens and temperature parameters can be adjusted in the translate_text function in app.py to modify the translation output.
Make sure to keep your API key confidential and avoid sharing it in your code or repositories.
